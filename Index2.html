    <h1>Iron Age: The Roman Empire</h1>
    <h4>By Shourya, Aayan And Sahibjit</h4>
    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>Iron weapons had a role in the Roman military's success, which was largely due to the Iron Age, which began long before Rome expanded into a global empire. Of course, the use of iron by Rome's adversaries was the cause of its destruction. How ironic is that? The height of the Roman Empire in 117 CE.</p>
    <h2>Daily Life</h2>
    <p>A light breakfast would be consumed before heading to work in a typical Roman day. Early in the afternoon, when work was finished, many Romans would quickly travel to the baths to take a bath and socialise. They would have dinner at around 3 o'clock, which was more of a social gathering than a meal.</p>

    <h2>Differences Between Old And New Maps</h2>
    <p>Old maps were not consistent in their scales, their language, their naming procedures, the material they were either produced on or printed on later, or most importantly, their symbology. New maps allowed a uniformity of all the things that old maps, and old cartographers, used individually and personal
        Old maps were highly prized articles of information and exploration and as such were treated as valuable and important documents to be preserved, updated, and protected. New maps are printed on cheap paper, readily available, and easily obtained almost anywhere.</p>

People across a substantial chunk of Europe, Asia, and areas of Africa began producing tools and weapons out of iron and steel during the Iron Age.</p>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
