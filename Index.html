<h2> General Information</h2>
<p>The Hittites founded one of the great empires of the ancient Middle East between 1400 and 1200 B.C.E. At its height, the empire included Upper Mesopotamia, central Turkey, and northwestern Syria (north eastern Syria and northern Iraq). The Hittites acquired many Mesopotamian customs, notably the cuneiform writing system, while speaking an Indo-European language. Archaeologists have uncovered cuneiform-written clay tablets with royal archives from the capital, Hattusa.</p>
<h2>Daily Life</h2>
<p>The Hittites lived in a largely male-dominated patriarchal society. The social organisation resembled a family clan system, with a patriarch or head overseeing a large extended family. However, it appears that royal women had some involvement in leadership even if men controlled the government.</p> 
<h2>Beginning & Ending</h2>
<p>The Hittite Empire peaked during the rule of King Suppiluliuma I (c. 1344-1322 BCE) and his son Mursilli II (c. 1321-1295 BCE), after which it collapsed and was eventually conquered by the Assyrians after being repeatedly attacked by the Sea Peoples and the Kaska tribe. It started at c.1600 BC & ended c.1180 BCE.</p>
<h2>Why They Were Famous</h2>
<p>The Hittites were renowned for their mastery of chariot construction and operation. They also invented the production and application of iron. By 1300, Egypt and the Hittite Empire shared a border, and both fought for control of prosperous cities along the Mediterranean coast. Rameses II engaged in the Battle of Kadesh as a result (1274 B.C.E.)</p>
<h2>Tools,Weaponry & Resources</h2>
<p>The soft-as-butter bronze swords of the Egyptians and Assyrians were no match for the extremely robust iron swords of the Hittites. The Hittites were practically invincible in the battlefield thanks to these "Bronze Age lightsabers. The Hittites were also expert metallurgists, or individuals who research the characteristics and makeup of metals, and they had iron mines in the northern region of their empire close to the Black Sea. They learned how to forge iron into armour and weapons and how strong it is. The ore was first smelted, or transformed into a liquid. They utilised charcoal to smelt it rather than just a wood fire, which added carbon to the iron and increased its strength. They employed a method that had never before been used and heated the iron piece in the fire to soften the metal before shaping it with a hammer. The hammering made these tools more durable and powerful, as well as sharpening the blades. The Hittites were able to equip their army with weapons and armour at a lower cost because iron was also less expensive. They were also able to grow their economy by dealing with nearby countries who did not know how to work with iron.</p>
<h2>Gods</h2>
<p>The Hittites themselves boasted of a thousand gods, but Teshub, the storm deity, whose animal symbol was the bull, was considered to be the most significant. The Hittite king was a major figure in religious ceremonies. These included bathing him to atone for sin committed by all.</p>
<h2>Artefacts</h2>
<p>Some of these artefacts were bronze sculptures of bulls or deer, ceremonial symbols and sun disks. They also used engravings in caves or on religious stones. These artefacts are housed today in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara.</p>
<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
